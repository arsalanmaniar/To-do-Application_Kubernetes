# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive task breakdown for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application frontend integration feature. Created 48 detailed tasks across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 User Stories (US1-3) in priority order. Tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each phase has clear goals and independent test criteria. Implementation strategy prioritizes core authentication and task management (US1) as MVP, followed by enhanced CRUD operations (US2), and secure API communication (US3).

## Outcome
- 48 tasks generated across 6 phases
- Proper checklist format with [ ], T### IDs, [P] parallel markers, [US#] story labels
- Clear dependencies and execution order defined
- Independent test criteria for each phase
- File paths specified for all tasks
- Ready for implementation with /sp.implement
